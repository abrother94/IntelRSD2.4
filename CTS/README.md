# Conformance Test Suite
## Overview

The Intel® Rack Scale Design (Intel® RSD) Conformance Test Suite (CTS) tool verifies the northbound API schema conformance of the Pooled System Management (PSME) / Rack Management Module (RMM) and Pod Manager through automated techniques. The tool can also test some hardware and software parameters.

### Data Structure of CTS

| Description | Path |
|--|--|
|CTS database|`HOME_FOLDER/.cts/db/`|
|CTS general configuration|`HOME_DIR/.cts/configuration/`|
|CTS internal tests|`HOME_FOLDER/.cts/tests/`|
|Tests data|`HOME_FOLDER/.cts/tests_data/`
|User tests|`/opt/cts/tests/`|
|CTS log| `/var/log/cts/`|

* Test configuration:

    CTS requires that test configuration is part of every `cts execute` command.
    It is possible to use a single configuration file, but CTS accepts more than one configuration file, which users may find convenient. If multiple files are used, configuration files are concatenated and when there is a conflict, the value from the file on the right takes precedence over the value from the file on the left.

    * Create `config_file.ini` with the following keys:

        *  __ApiEndpoint__ - Endpoint to API in format ip:port
        *  __UseSSL__ - Defines if CTS shall use http or https protocol to connect to the API (Yes/No)
        *  __CertificateCertFile__ and __CertificateKeyFile__ - Absolute paths to client side pem certificate and key files (if API requires client certificate authorization)
        *  __User__ and __Password__ - User and Password used by CTS to authorize (if API requires basic authorization)

        The above set of keys is mandatory for all tests. They tell CTS how to connect to an API endpoint.

        Other optional keys are:

        *  __IgnoreTypes__ - User may specify that entities of certain types should not be validated by CTS. Use a comma to ignore more than one type. Example:
        `
        IgnoreTypes=Bios.1.1.0.Bios, TypeToIgnore.1.0.1.TypeToIgnore
        `
        *  __MapTypes__ - User may declare that CTS should use a known type to validate a specific unknown type. Example:
        `
        MapTypes=ComputerSystem.v2_0_0:ComputerSystem.v1_0_0
        `
        *  __EventListenerAddr__ - This flag is only used for CRUD Events tests. It should represent the IP and, optionally, a port on the device with CTS running, so that it's reachable from the tested device.
        `
        EventListenerAddr=10.0.1.2:8888
        `
        CTS will use ComputerSystem.v1_0_0 schema do validate ComputerSystem.v2_0_0 entities
        *  __ServiceTypeOverride__ - If the service implements more than one service type such as combined Pooled System Management Engine (PSME) and Rack Management Module (RMM), CTS must be informed that entities from both services may exist together on the REST. This prevents CTS from raising errors about unknown RMM types when the PSME test package is executed.

            Possible values are: PODM_2_4, PSME_2_4, RMM_2_4, SS_2_4

            Example:
            `
            ServiceTypeOverride=PSME_2_4,RMM_2_4
            `

    * Create `hardware_check_list.ini` with the configuration required by the `hardware_check_list` test script. Skip this file if checking hardware requirements is not planned. If you prefer to maintain a single configuration file, add these keys to `config_file.ini` (created above):
        *  __IsPsmePresent__ - Declare (Yes/No). Rack must have one or more PSME software components.
        *  __PowerEfficiency__ - Declared power efficiency (number < 100).
        *  __FanPositionNumberingConsistent__ - Declare (Yes/No). Service personnel should be able to easily identify the location of a failed fan for replacement. Intel recommends that the fan position location label use the base as 1 and be numbered from left to right or right to left or top to bottom or bottom to top, in each subsystem (rack, drawer, or module).
        *  __PowerSupplyPositionNumberingConsistent__ - Declare (Yes/No). Service personnel should be able to easily identify the location of a power supply failure for replacement. Intel recommends that the power supply position location label use the base as 1 and be numbered from left to right or top to bottom, in each subsystem (rack, drawer, or module).
        *  __IsRMMNetworkPrivateManagement__ - (Yes/No)
        *  __AreManagementAndProductionNetworksSeparated__ - (Yes/No)
        *  __AreComputeBladesServiceableIndependently__ - (Yes/No)


## Basic Usage
### Browsing Available Test Packages, Test Suites, and Test Cases
* To list all available test packages:

  ```
  cts tests list
  ```

* To filter by package name:

  ```
  cts tests list -p Rack_Scale_2_4_POD_Manager
  ```

* To filter by package and test suite names:

  ```
  cts tests list -p Rack_Scale_2_4_POD_Manager -s required
  ```

* To generate a sample configuration file for test case:

  ```
  cts tests generate_config PACKAGE_NAME TEST_SCRIPT_NAME -o output_file_with_configuration.ini
  ```

### Execution

* To simply execute all tests for Rack_Scale_2_4_POD_Manager validation:

  ```
  cts execute tests Rack_Scale_2_4_POD_Manager --config_files config_file.ini
  ```

* To execute only tests for metadata compliance:

  ```
  cts execute tests Rack_Scale_2_4_POD_Manager --test_suites required --config_files config_file.ini
  ```

* To execute only a test validating get responses' compliance with provided metadata:

  ```
  cts execute tests Rack_Scale_2_4_POD_Manager --test_scripts validate_get_responses --config_files config_file.ini
  ```

* To set timeout for each script executed, add the flag `-T --timeout`:

  ```
  cts execute tests Rack_Scale_2_4_POD_Manager --config_files config_file.ini -T timeout_in_seconds
  ```

### Test Results Browsing
* To list all test executions:

  ```
  cts status list
  ```

* To show detailed information about a specified execution:

  ```
  cts status show RUN_ID
  ```

* To delete a result from the CTS database:

  ```
  cts status delete RUN_ID
  ```

* To save results to a file (when the "html" option is selected, a new folder called `cts_report` containing html files will be created in your working directory):

  ```
  cts status dump RUN_ID --output_format [html/csv/text]
  ```

### Additional Options
* Show CTS Version:

  ```
  cts version
  ```

* The `CTS SOS` command prepares a package for easier debugging. Use this command when you suspect a CTS crash and want to report an issue related to CTS. This command collects information (CTS logs, network configuration, pip dependencies, etc.) and after running the command your working directory should contain an `sos-report-<date>` folder and an `sos-report-<date>.tar.gz` archive.

  ```
  cts sos
  ```


## Advanced Usage

### Using Run List to Execute Multiple Tests with a Single Command

Run list is a mechanism that enables multi-step execution and makes it possible to plan more advanced test scenarios.
Execution of a run list is very similar to executing a test script.


```
cts execute run_list run_list_2_4
```


`run_list_2_4` is a test specification prepared by the user. It defines the scope of tests to be executed and the configuration that should be used to run tests.
Below is an example of a run list that can be used to execute all 2.4 tests:


    $ cat run_list_2_4

    [PSME_2_4]
    TEST_PACKAGE = Rack_Scale_2_4_PSME
    TEST_SUITES = required
    TEST_CONFIGS = ./config/psme.ini, ./config/hardware_check_list.ini

    [StorageServices_2_4]
    TEST_PACKAGE = Rack_Scale_2_4_Storage_Services
    TEST_SUITES = required
    TEST_CONFIGS = ./config/storage.ini

    [PODM_2_4]
    TEST_PACKAGE = Rack_Scale_2_4_POD_Manager
    TEST_SUITES = required
    TEST_CONFIGS = ./config/podm.ini, ./config/hardware_check_list.ini

    [RMM_2_4]
    TEST_PACKAGE = Rack_Scale_2_4_RMM
    TEST_SUITES = required
    TEST_CONFIGS = ./config/rmm.ini, ./config/hardware_check_list.ini

The `run list` definition refers to additional configuration files:

     $ cat config/psme.ini
    [PSME]
    ApiEndpoint = <IP:PORT>
    UseSSL = Yes
    User = admin
    Password = admin

    $ cat config/storage.ini
    [StorageServices]
    ApiEndpoint = <IP:PORT>
    UseSSL = Yes
    User = admin
    Password = admin

    $ cat config/podm.ini
    [PSME]
    ApiEndpoint = <IP:PORT>
    UseSSL = Yes
    User = admin
    Password = admin

    $ cat config/rmm.ini
    [RMM]
    ApiEndpoint = <IP:PORT>
    UseSSL = Yes
    User = admin
    Password = admin

    $ cat config/hardware_check_list.ini
    [HardwareCheckList]
    PowerEfficiency = 90
    FanPositionNumberingConsistent = Yes
    PowerSupplyPositionNumberingConsistent = Yes
    IsRMMNetworkPrivateManagement = Yes
    AreManagementAndProductionNetworksSeparated = Yes

## Test Description

### API Get Validation

You can run the API Get Validation tests by passing a flag:

```
--test_scripts validate_get_responses
```

The test is read-only and checks that resources exposed on the REST service are compliant with metadata as part of the RSD specification. CTS raises an error if any of the following conditions occur:

* Property defined as 'required' is not present
* Unknown property is detected in an instance of type that does not allow additional properties
* Value of a property has incorrect type
* Value of a property has a value out of range (resulting from type itself or when min/max values are defined)
* Value of a property does not match a defined regular expression (if any are defined in metadata)
* Resource or object of an unknown type is detected


API Get Validation is the most basic test that is available in CTS. Therefore, it should be executed as the first test, since API correctness is a prerequisite for the rest of the tests.

### API Patch Validation

You can run the API Patch Validation tests by passing a flag:

```
--test_scripts validate_patch_responses
```

The test iterates through all resources discovered on the REST API in search of patchable properties (that is, properties with OData.Permissions/ReadWrite annotation declared in metadata). Based on the property definition, CTS generates a new value and issues a PATCH request followed by GET for verification purposes. If return codes and verification results are correct, the test case passes. Otherwise, CTS reports a warning. When CTS finishes with an actual API resource, the original state is restored.

Intel advises that you run this test immediately after API Get Validation.

### Hardware Checklist Validation

You can run the Hardware Checklist Validation tests by passing a flag:

```
--test_scripts hardware_check_list
```

The test suite consists of both manual and automatic tests that verify requirements from the Platform Design Specification document are met.

Manual tests require an additional set of configuration parameters to work (refer to the Test Configuration section). CTS verifies that values provided by the user conform with the PDS document.

The scope of automatic testing is as follows:

* CTS verifies that at least one compute module is present in the POD
* CTS verifies that at least one Ethernet switch is present in the POD
* CTS verifies that at least one Ethernet-based fabric is present in the POD
* CTS verifies that API endpoint uses secure channel (SSL) to serve API
* CTS checks if client is able to perform computer system reset
* CTS checks that all API chassis resources define location
* CTS checks that chassis hierarchy is consistent
* CTS checks that Power Monitoring is possible at Rack level


### CRUD Tests

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tests by passing a flag:

```
--test_scripts crud_operations
```

The test tries to create an instance of a resource, then checks if it was created correctly. Next, it attempts to patch the resource, rechecks the correctness, again and finally deletes it. The test is supposed to clean up the changes it made no matter when it comes to a stop (for example, if the service created resources incorrectly, it skips the patch but still tries to delete it). The following resources are tested:

* PSME: VLAN network interface (without patching - not supported by the REST API)
* Storage Services: Logical Drive, Remote Target (for either LVM or CEPH storage)


## Additional Functionality

### Metadata diff

CTS can be used for testing API compliance as well as comparing metadata. The comparison report is
saved in a text file as shown below:

    $ cts metadata diff --help
    usage: cts diff [-h] [-q [QUALIFIERS [QUALIFIERS ...]]] METADATA METADATA

    positional arguments:
      METADATA              can be any of:
                            - configuration file with remote endpoint definition
                            - RSD release
                              Possible values are:
                            PODM_2_4, PSME_2_4, RMM_2_4, SS_2_4
                            - path to directory that holds metadata xml files

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -q [QUALIFIERS [QUALIFIERS ...]], --qualifiers [QUALIFIERS [QUALIFIERS ...]]



## Troubleshooting
### Issue 1
* When I ran INSTALL.sh I get:
  ```
  INSTALL.sh: line 317: cts: command not found
  ```
### Solution
  There may be an error related to the pip install process. Reinstall pip's CTS package manually with this command:
  ```
  sudo pip install CTS-{version-number}-py2-none-any.whl
  ```

  Where _{version-number}_ is for example: CTS-**2.4.0.47.0**-py2-none-any.whl

  If you are behind a proxy, you need to add additional param:

  ```
  sudo pip install --proxy http://{proxy-url}:{proxy-port} CTS-{version-number}-py2-none-any.whl
  ```

  Where _{proxy-url}_ and _{proxy-port}_ depend on your network settings.

### Issue 2
* I ran a test (with the specified *--test_scripts*), but nothing happened.

### Solution

  ```
  $ cts execute tests Rack_Scale_2_4_POD_Manager --test_scripts validate_patch_responses -c config_files.ini
  ```

Using CTS in version 2.4.14.0, no scripts where selected to execution.


  The CTS files in `~/.cts/`may have been created using a root account and their ownership has to be changed:

  ```
  [sudo] chown -R USER_NAME ~/.cts/
  [sudo] chmod a+x -R ~/.cts/tests/
  ```

### Issue 3
* I got an error `IOError`, when I ran a test.

### Solution

  The CTS directory `~/.cts/` may have been created using a root account and its ownership has to be changed:

  ```
  [sudo] chown -R USER_NAME ~/.cts
  ```

## New Features
The Intel RSD v2.3. (CTS_2.3.0.95.0) release introduces the following features:

1.	New CRUD test for Storage Service (crud_operations.py) has been introduced.
2.	Stability improvenents
3.	Minor bug fixes

The following list describes all the limitations for this release. Described limitations are targeted for future releases:

* CTS package does not contain test and metadata packages for older version of  RSD.
* CRUD for Storage Services does not support NVMe operations. The CRUD test case for Storage Services is based on a previous software version (see v2.1 of Intel RSD).

## Limitations
In v2.3 of Intel RSD we introduce support for Non-volatile Memory Express (NVMe)* technology but our CRUD test case for Storage Services does not support NVMe* operations. The
CRUD test case for Storage Services is based on a previous software version (see v2.1 of Intel RSD).
